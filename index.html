    <div class=the-other-center> Hello, my name is Anthony Easom! I am a senior at PSU and I am a pure mathematics major with a computing minor. In college, I have found a deep interest in programming and any math topics adjacent to programming, such as logic and discrete math. I have lived in Pittsburg all my life, so I have deep roots here and at PSU. </div>

      <p> I am very passionate about music and have been playing various instruments since I was very young. Mainly playing piano, I briefly played guitar and then played percussion from sixth grade until the end of high school, preferring mallet percussion. In addition to this, I try to experience a wide variety of different music and artists. I definitely have preferences, but my taste varies. At the current moment, my favorite artists are:</p>

        <li>Jakey</li>
        <li>Tom Misch</li>
